### Release Notes

* While running under Docker, the script will now change the ownership of the runtime directory mounted into the container to be in line with the UID and GID values specified through environment variables `DRPP_UID` and `DRPP_GID`, if both are set (#77). Refer to the [UID and GID section](https://github.com/phin05/discord-rich-presence-plex/blob/v2.4.5/README.md#uid-and-gid) of the README for more information.
